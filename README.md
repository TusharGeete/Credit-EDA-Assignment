# Credit Risk Analysis Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project conducts a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit risk dataset to identify the key factors contributing to loan defaults. The analysis aims to assist lending companies in minimizing financial risks while ensuring creditworthy applicants are not unfairly denied loans.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Imbalance Analysis**: Investigate the distribution of loan defaults versus non-defaults and develop strategies to mitigate any imbalances.
- **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis**: Conduct comprehensive analyses on individual variables and their relationships with loan defaults, visualizing trends and identifying significant predictors.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify the top correlations between various features and the target variable (loan default) to understand influential factors.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## Key Findings
- Discovered critical indicators of loan default, providing actionable recommendations for risk assessment in the lending process.
- Visualized results to facilitate understanding among stakeholders, supporting data-driven decision-making.
